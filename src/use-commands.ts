 * Contribute commands for as long as the calling component is mounted.

 * `source` is either a plain array or — for sets too large to materialise
 * eagerly — a factory that receives the current query:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const commands = useMemo(() => [{ id: "event.new", title: "אירוע חדש", run: open }], [open]);
 * useCommands(commands);
 * ```
 *
 * **`source` must be referentially stable** (`useMemo`/`useCallback`). A fresh
 * value every render would re-register on every render; a changed value is
 * exactly what tells an open palette to recompute.
